1. Why did you choose class for ShoppingCart?

    I chose class type for cart because cart should have a single shared object that can be updated and passed around.
    For example in real life shop you take one cart and go around the shop with it, same cart while you're shopping, 
    and if you pass this cart for example to your friend, then he will have same items that you placed there.
    This way changes made in one place are same everywhere.



2. Why did you choose struct for Product and Order?

    Because Product and Order should all be independent, each instance is a different item.
    Each product shoudnt affect each other. For example two bottles of water at a store, if you drink one, or take the label off, 
    it wont affect the other one, or the other ones for that matter



3. Explain one example where reference semantics matter in your code

    



4. Explain one example where value semantics matter in your code




5. What challenges did you face and how did you solve them?

    Testing the project, I initially created swift project and had problems with test running it, then replaced everything into playground project
    and also had some problems with visibility of all classes.
    Also, at first i wasnt sure how exactly to find item in items array to remove or add it.
    I wasnt sure how to do getters and setters in swift and at first tried to write them like in Java OOP.
